## Hi there

### What I'm doing and what I know

- Using **PHP** to build web applications, mostly using **Yii2** framework in recent years.
- Programming languages have their own solutions, and I love to try to use the right tool to solve problems.
  + PHP, script language, fast development, and easy deployment, but poor of naming convention.
  + Python, script language, AI
  + .NET (core) and C#, static typed, long history, new direction for cloud and cross platform, similar to Java
  + Java, tech committee, good community
  + Golang, modern, static typed, simplified, system programming
  + Rust, modern, static typed, memory safety, system programming
  + C, system programming, base language for many others
  + C++
- Many years of using linux desktop and server, and I have a dream to become a kernel developer in someday.
