## Hi there

### What I'm doing

- Using **PHP** to build web applications, mostly using **Yii2** framework in recent years.
- Learning .NET (core), love its familarity and performance, preparing for the next hop.
- I'm a programming language enthusiast, like php / c# / go / java / rust / swift / kotlin / c / c++ etc.
- Playing linux box everyday, love debian best, and I have a dream to become a kernel developer in someday.
